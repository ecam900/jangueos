# Dimelo
I made this app for a book club we're working on (Dune!). The drive behind it was that many friends don't want to use Facebook, or Whatsapp and that was our main way to discuss the book. To circumvent having to use any of those major services I made my own. 

# Features:
- Private Groups with access code invitation
- Markdown Support for Group Descriptions, and Posts.
- Rooms within groups (for chapter discussions, for example).
- Authentication with Firebase, with Password or Magic Link signin.
